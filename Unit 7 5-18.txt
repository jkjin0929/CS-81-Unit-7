18. Explain, in detail, what happens when this script is run:

	var shout = function () {
		var message = "HEY YOU";
		alert(message);
	};
	shout();
	alert(message);

Answer: shout(); will call for function generate "HEY YOU" message while alert(message); won't(generates a message saying that message is not defined). It is because the variable message is defined within the function shout(local variable) therefore outside of that function, message is not defined.
